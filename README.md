## About my own changes to the project
I am also going to add few lines to resize images of pieces.<br>
I saw that in tutorial author uses pictures of prepared size.<br>
Added some changes to the variable names, because author used not pythonic naming convention (he actually says that he is the JAVA guy).<br>
Also added my own pieces and colors for game board.<br>
Added functionality for making pieces smaller than the squares.<br>
Rewrote some functions ('undo_move', get_piece_move for each piece) on my own way.
## Notes
Found out that not only the pieces are redrawed, but the whole gameboard is.
